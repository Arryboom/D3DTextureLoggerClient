<h1>D3DTextureLoggerClient</h1>

This program allows you to easily go through the list of primitives in memory at any given time.  It eliminates the need to manually increase prims and verts until you hit the texture you want.  Clicking the "Save Prim" number saves a screenshot of the currently selected prim textured in red and saves it to the Output folder in the executable's directory.
